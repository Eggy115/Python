# PythonNotepad

Notepad made in Python with Tkinter (and some other things). It *is* a .pyw, but that is just so the console window doesn't come up (you don't need it anyway).

Help just displays basic help.

Edit allows you to Copy, Paste and Cut.

Pressing File allows you to save the file, create a new one, open an existing file, or just close the application.
